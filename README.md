# Diabetes Risk Prediction AI Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the AI project aimed at predicting the risk of diabetes for patients using machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assess the risk of diabetes in patients based on various factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.

## Data Collection
- Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- Include information on the features included in the dataset (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.).
- Mention any preprocessing steps performed on the data (e.g., handling missing values, normalization, etc.).

## Model Development
- Specify the machine learning algorithm(s) used for building the predictive model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
- Describe the model architecture and parameters chosen.
- Detail the process of training the model on the dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Specify the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.).
- Provide the results of the model evaluation on the test dataset.
- Include any visualizations or plots to illustrate the performance metrics.

## Deployment
- Discuss the deployment strategy for integrating the model into a real-world application.
- Specify any APIs or frameworks used for model deployment.
- Provide instructions for using the model to predict diabetes risk for new patients.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and outcomes of the project.
Discuss any limitations or areas for future improvement.
Highlight the significance of the project in healthcare and its implications.

## References
Include any references to research papers, articles, or resources used in the project.
